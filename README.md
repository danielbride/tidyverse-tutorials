# Intermountain Healthcare R Users Group tidyverse Series

## Interactive Tutorials created with `learnr` package

This page serves two purposes: 

1. Remove some of the technical overhead of installing and configuring R
and RStudio in order to learn R and follow along with live coding.
2. Provide the platform for interactive tutorials where learning content and
practice exercises are directly adjacent.

You can interact with the content in the first session in two ways:
